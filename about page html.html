      <H2>INTRODUCTION</H2> 
  <br>The world perceives us as a low-cost Indian healthcare service provider;<br>
     what we are engaged in is a passionate journey to establish ourselves as the lowest-cost, <br>
    high-quality healthcare service provider in the world.<br> 
    At NVL, we are convinced that 'quality' and 'lowest cost' are not mutually exclusive when it comes to healthcare delivery.<br> 
    In fact, we are well on our way to demonstrate that we are not running our institution as just another number-only business,<br>
     but are attractively placed to create an affordable, globally-benchmarked quality-driven healthcare services model.<br>
    Routine childhood vaccinations are an important way to ensure that your child and community remain healthy and protected against serious diseases.<br>
     If not done so, this can lead to many horrendous repercussions.<br>
    Hence, this is a website rather an online platform that guides, appoints and certifies child vaccinations.<br>

         <div class="why">
      <h3> WHY NVL?</h3>
    NVL will assure that every newborn gets proper access to vaccinations in their actual present time location.<br>
    So, that more and more of the world’s children are vaccinated and protected.<br>
    Our website allows parents to login to our website by entering valid email id or their respective phone numbers, <br> 
    resulting in an automated OTP generation, so that user login details can be authenticized. <br>
    The user will also get a standard chart of required vaccines and then you can search the nearest vaccination  center to get the job done. <br>
    The center will then update the child’s vaccination chart.</br>
         </div>

    <div class="aim">
      <h3> AIM:</h3>
    The main aim is to get 100% vaccinated across regions.<br> 
    To display the total number of registrations with respect to state/area or nearest hospitals.<br>
    Addition of locations of the hospitals based on the data you input on the website.<br>
    To display the timings and availability of the doses in the selected hospitals.<br>

    <h5>PROBLEMS:</h5>
    The poorer sections of the society don’t have well knowledge regarding the importance of vaccination.<br>
    What happens if a child doesn’t get all doses of the recommended vaccines?<br>
   <h5> SOLUTIONS:</h5>
    NVL when associated with government hospitals, will help fix this problem.<br>
    When a child misses any important vaccine dose, the risk of diseases can increase, which can affect the health of a child.<br> 
     So NVL will help design a properly structured schedule so that this risk reduces.
